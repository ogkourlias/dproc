Job 0: executing bwa mem on the following data/genome.fa data/samples/B.fastq to generate the following mapped_reads/B.bam
Reason: Missing output files: mapped_reads/B.bam

Error in rule bwa_map:
    jobid: 0
    input: data/genome.fa, data/samples/B.fastq
    output: mapped_reads/B.bam
    shell:
        bwa mem data/genome.fa data/samples/B.fastq | samtools view -Sb - > mapped_reads/B.bam
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job bwa_map since they might be corrupted:
mapped_reads/B.bam
